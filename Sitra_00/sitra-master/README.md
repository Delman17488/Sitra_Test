SiTra
=====

[SiTra] [1] is a simple Java library for supporting a programming approach to writing
transformations aiming to, firstly use Java for writing transformations, and
secondly, to provide a minimal framework for the execution of transformations.
SiTra consists of two interfaces and a class that implements a transformation
algorithm. The aim is to facilitate a style of programming that incorporates the
concept of transformation rules. The two interfaces are as follows and are
described below.
